# Dot-Files

My dot files. Viewer discretion advised.

## .vimrc

This is my custom, cleaned and updated .vimrc. I'll update this readme as I
progress. I'm basing on Amix's awesome .vimrc file, but this is not a fork.
Also, this is customized for me, should you use it, you should read it and
customize it for you too.
